        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            <em>Grids</em> are made up of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines. For instance, if you look at a city map, you’ll notice
            streets crossing paths, forming a clear structure to the city’s layout. This is because a lot of them were designed and
            built using a grid system.
            
            As a designer, grid systems help you organize your designs and provides a series of guidelines to properly align
            elements on a page. Using this visual layout system can help easily define the space needed between elements, while
            creating content that guides the user on how to navigate the web page.
            
            Grids can also promote consistency, allowing you to build repeated patterns to carry throughout your designs. Through
            the use of repetition, the learning curve of using your website can be significantly reduced allowing users to clearly
            navigate and consume the content.
            
            Let’s explore the different parts of a grid system and discuss how it can help enhance your designs with consistency,
            alignment, and spacing.
        </p>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Grid Types</h2>
            <p>
                Various types of grids exist and are used within all types of visual design. With the creation of the printing press,
                bookmakers developed a manuscript-style grid, or a block grid, to bring structure to text on pages. Within news design,
                the column grid allowed publishers to break the page apart into sections to emphasize different pieces of content.
                
                Similar to news design, the most common type of grid a web designer will use is the column grid. The column grid breaks
                up a page into vertical units that span the width of the content, and this grid structure can dictate how elements are
                laid out with precision and elegance.
                
                Let’s continue to explore the anatomy of a grid and what it comprises.
            </p>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Grid Anatomy</h2>
                <p>
                    When designing a website, the grid comprises three major components: columns, gutters, and margins.
                    <ul>
                        <li>     Columns are defined as the vertical sections that span the width of a page. In web design, it’s common to see layouts
                            consisting of 12 or 16 columns, while other may only feature three columns. Defining the number of columns depends on
                            what’s appropriate for your design, device, and or screen viewing size.
                        </li>
                        <li> Next, a gutter is the negative space between each column. Gutters help in ensuring the columns don’t run together, which
                            would negate the purpose of using a column-based grid.
                        </li>
                        <li> Margins appear on the left and right sides of the column-based grid. These ensure the content of your designs doesn’t
                            match up to the edges of the browser window. It’s important to note, margins may vary depending on the width of the grid, browser window, or device. For larger
                            displays, margins may be very noticeable while on smaller screens, they may have the same width as a gutter.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>
                <div class="aside">
                    <h2>Grid Columns</h2>
                    <p>
                        <em>Columns</em> are the vertical containers that span the width of the page. They can be dependent on each other, meaning they are used
                        to organize related content such as a continuation of a paragraph. They can also be independent of each other, meaning
                        they are used for organizing the layout of unrelated content such as a sidebar. This allows for the flexibility of
                        organizing information.
                        
                        <p>Within a grid, content can span multiple columns. What this means is that a website does not need to maintain the same
                        column layout throughout. For example, a section of a website with a 12 column grid can have content that spans 4
                        columns, three times.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the designer, you have the option to maintain this layout throughout the website. Or you can choose to use various
                        layouts, including having the content span the whole width of the grid, half the grid or only a small portion of the
                        grid.</p>
                        
                        <p>While we will talk about this in more detail in just a few exercises, columns are separated by gutters. This design term
                        is referred to as the space or gap between two columns. No content can spill into the gutter unless it is using the next
                        column.</p>
                        
                        <p>Columns can also be used to push, or offset content. Say you want to only display content on the right 4 columns of a
                        page while using a 12 column grid. To do this, you can easily offset the content by 8 columns so the content is pushed
                        to those right 4 columns.</p>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <h2>grid Rows</h2>
                    <p><em>Rows</em> are the horizontal lines on a grid. Think of rows as invisible boxes that groups content together by height. Rows are
                        commonly used in web designs to group content together and re-order other content to allow for more whitespace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, let’s say you have a set of items that all span the same amount of columns and you want them to align
                        across the page without being disrupted by other elements. One way to achieve this outcome is to wrap the content in a
                        row component. This will force any content, not inside of the row, to be pushed away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, remember that a row can be used to force content away from an area that has remaining columns not used. What does
                        this mean? Great question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s say our design uses a 12 column grid and we want one element to span seven columns. That means we still have five
                        unfilled columns to either the left or the right side. Naturally, any new content added to our document will try and
                        fill this unused space. However, by placing a row element around our component that spans 7 columns we can force any new
                        content to start beneath our component and leave the remaining 5 columns empty.
                    </p>
                
                </div>
                <div class="gutter">
                    <h2>grid gutters</h2>
                    <p>
                        <em>Gutters</em> make up the negative space between columns. This design element helps to provide a natural break between elements
                        aligned horizontally, while also helping to break rows of content vertically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note, there will always be one less gutter than the total number of columns. For example, if you are designing on a 12
                        column grid, then you will only have 11 gutters. One for every gap that separates each column.
                    </p>
                    <aside>
                        While there is no set standard for a gutter width, it’s best practice to select a size that visually separates
                        horizontal columns but is significantly thinner than the width of a column. The same can be said for vertical gutters.
                    </aside>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, vertical and horizontal gutters do not need to match in size for a given grid layout. This is because you as a
                        designer may want more vertical spacing then horizontal spacing when separating elements on a page.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember, if the gutter space is too tight, it can be hard to visually tell where one element ends and another starts.
                        On the other hand, if the gutter space is too large, the design can be hard to follow.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="responsive">
                    <h2>Responsive Grid</h2>
                    <p>
                        When designing web content, a designer needs to take into account the different screen-sizes a user might encounter and
                        how that will affect a website’s layout. Many websites utilize responsive design, a set of techniques that allow a
                        website’s content to shift based on the device or screen size. Because of these changes, responsive design requires a
                        different number of total columns based on screen size, in order to accommodate content and keep it from being squished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consider your mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Now think about their viewable areas. All are substantially different
                        in size. Thus, it’s common practice in web design to create responsive grid sizes. On a large or desktop device you may
                        start with a 12 column grid, but on a small or mobile device, you adjust the 12 column grid to a 4 column grid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a designer, responsive grid design enables you to maximize the content on the screen, ensuring a more accessible
                        experience for users. Additionally, your design elements will have sufficient space to breath and content can naturally
                        flow across the page.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="whitespace">
                    <h2>whitespace</h2>
                    <p>
                        Space is an important aspect of creating balanced and harmonious layouts in web design. As a designer, it’s important to
                        understand how space can enhance as well as hurt your designs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Whitespace</em>, or negative space, refers to the emptiness between elements. Whether that’s in the gutter of the columns, or
                        additional padding around a block of text. As a designer, don’t be afraid of using space to enhance the usability of
                        your site and prioritize the content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s explore some examples of good whitespace. If you look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com</a> in the workspace, you will notice that the
                        website embraces whitespace on its landing page. It focuses the user’s attention solely on the primary
                        action, which is searching for content. In this case, the whitespace is white in color as well. However, whitespace
                        isn’t always going to be white.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whitespace is broken up into passive and active
                    </p>
                </div>
                    <div class="container passive whitespace">
                    <ul>
                        <li><h2>Passive Whitespace</h2>
                            <p>
                                The first type of whitespace we will discuss is called passive whitespace or micro whitespace. Used to improve the
                                aesthetics of the layout without guiding the user through a specific reading, flow, or content order, passive whitespace
                                is sometimes referred to as the unconsidered space. The most frequent use of passive whitespace comes within text
                                elements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Different font families have varying amounts of passive whitespace and you can control aspects of them within your
                                design by altering CSS properties such as such as line-height or margin when setting type.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By adjusting the space between your lines of text, you can improve the designs overall legibility and balance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a site’s text is too tight or lacks sufficient margin below headings and paragraphs, it can be hard for users to
                                consume the content. However, if the site’s text is too spaced out it can make it just as hard to read.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finding a healthy balance between text that lacks sufficient spacing and text that has too much is an important task for
                                designers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2>Active Whitespace</h2>
                            <p>
                                Unlike passive whitespace, which occurs more naturally, active whitespace is intentional. Also called macro whitespace,
                                active whitespace refers to enhancing the overall page structure through space to emphasize content or guide users from
                                one point to the next.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By adding active whitespace to a site’s design, we can spread our different sections out. This technique helps guide the
                                user through the page’s content more effectively, allowing users to consume and absorb content more easily.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Active whitespace comes in many forms. But traditionally, it is achieved by adding space between a site’s elements. For
                                instance, adding space to an articles sidebar helps to visually separate the content from the page’s main content.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, this type of whitespace allows readers to quickly understand what they should be focusing on versus what
                                is just supplementary details.
                            </p>

                        Congratulations! You should have an understanding of grid structure, the components that make up a grid, and how to use
                        them to properly space elements within your design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember, the reasons we design using grids are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Promote consistency within our designs</li>
                        <li>Properly align elements on our page</li>
                        <li>Provide ample spacing between content</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Remember a grid is made up of:
                        
                        <p> *Columns *Gutters *Margins</p>
                        
                        <p>Spacing is incredibly important within a design to ensure:</p>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Elements have ample room to breath</li>
                        <li>Denote emphasis on certain parts of a page</li>
                        <li>Promote harmonious patterns and rhythms within your designs</li>
                    </ul>
