        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
            <p class="page-description clearfix">
            CSS uses media queries to adapt a website’s content to different screen sizes. With media queries, CSS can detect
            the
            size of the current screen and apply different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen.
        
            @media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
            body {
            font-size: 12px;
            }
            }
            The example above demonstrates how a media query is applied. The media query defines a rule for screens smaller than
            480
            pixels (approximately the width of many smartphones in landscape orientation).
        
            Let’s break this example down into its parts:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>@media</strong> — This keyword begins a media query rule and instructs the CSS compiler on how to parse
                the rest of the rule.</li>
            <li><strong>only screen</strong> — Indicates what types of devices should use this rule. In early attempts to target
                different devices, CSS
                incorporated different media types (screen, print, handheld). The rationale was that by knowing the media type,
                the
                proper CSS rules could be applied. However, “handheld” and “screen” devices began to occupy a much wider range
                of sizes
                and having only one CSS rule per media device was not sufficient. screen is the media type always used for
                displaying
                content, no matter the type of device. The only keyword is added to indicate that this rule only applies to one
                media
                type (screen).
            </li>
            <li> <strong>and (max-width : 480px)</strong> — This part of the rule is called a media feature, and instructs the
                CSS compiler to apply the
                CSS styles to devices with a width of 480 pixels or smaller. Media features are the conditions that must be met
                in order
                to render the CSS within a media query.
            </li>
            <li> CSS rules are nested inside of the media query’s curly braces. The rules will be applied when the media query
                is met. In
                the example above, the text in the body element is set to a font-size of 12px when the user’s screen is less
                than 480px.
            </li>
        </ol>
            </p>
        <h2>Range</h2>
            <p>
                Specific screen sizes can be targeted by setting multiple width and height media features. min-width and min-height are
                used to set the minimum width and minimum height, respectively. Conversely, max-width and max-height set the maximum
                width and maximum height, respectively.
                
                By using multiple widths and heights, a range can be set for a media query.
                
                @media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
                /* ruleset for 320px - 480px */
                }
                The example above would apply its CSS rules only when the screen size is between 320 pixels and 480 pixels. Notice the
                use of a second and keyword after the min-width media feature. This allows us to chain two requirements together.
                
                The example above can be written using two separate rules as well:
                
                @media only screen and (min-width: 320px) {
                /* ruleset for >= 320px */
                }
                
                
                @media only screen and (min-width: 480px) {
                /* ruleset for >= 480px */
                }
                The first media query in the example above will apply CSS rules when the size of the screen meets or exceeds 320 pixels.
                The second media query will then apply CSS rules when the size of the screen meets or exceeds 480 pixels, meaning that
                it can override CSS rules present in the first media query or apply additional CSS rules that are not already present in
                the first.
                
                Both examples above are valid, and it is likely that you will see both patterns used when reading another developer’s
                code.
            </p>
        <h2>Dots Per Inch (DPI)</h2>
        <p>
            Another media feature we can target is screen resolution. Many times we will want to supply higher quality media
            (images, video, etc.) only to users with screens that can support high resolution media. Targeting screen resolution
            also helps users avoid downloading high resolution (large file size) images that their screen may not be able to
            properly display.
            
            To target by resolution, we can use the min-resolution and max-resolution media features. These media features accept a
            resolution value in either dots per inch (dpi) or dots per centimeter (dpc). Learn more about resolution measurements
            here.
            
            @media only screen and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
            /* CSS for high resolution screens */
            }
            The media query in the example above targets high resolution screens by making sure the screen resolution is at least
            300 dots per inch. If the screen resolution query is met, then we can use CSS to display high resolution images and
            other media.
        </p>
        <h2>And Operator</h2>
        <p>
            In previous exercises, we chained multiple media features of the same type in one media query by using the and
            operator.
            It allowed us to create a range by using min-width and max-width in the same media query.
        
            The and operator can be used to require multiple media features. Therefore, we can use the and operator to require
            both
            a max-width of 480px and to have a min-resolution of 300dpi.
        
            For example:
        
            @media only screen and (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
            /* CSS ruleset */
            }
            By placing the and operator between the two media features, the browser will require both media features to be true
            before it renders the CSS within the media query. The and operator can be used to chain as many media features as
            necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>Comma Separated List</h2>
        <p>
            If only one of multiple media features in a media query must be met, media features can be separated in a comma
            separated list.
            
            For example, if we needed to apply a style when only one of the below is true:
            
            The screen is more than 480 pixels wide
            The screen is in landscape mode
            We could write:
            
            @media only screen and (min-width: 480px), (orientation: landscape) {
            /* CSS ruleset */
            }
            In the example above, we used a comma (,) to separate multiple rules. The example above requires only one of the media
            features to be true for its CSS to apply.
            
            Note that the second media feature is orientation. The orientation media feature detects if the page has more width than
            height. If a page is wider, it’s considered landscape, and if a page is taller, it’s considered portrait.
        </p>
        <h2>Breakpoints</h2>
        <p>
            We know how to use media queries to apply CSS rules based on screen size and resolution, but how do we determine what
            queries to set?
            
            The points at which media queries are set are called breakpoints. Breakpoints are the screen sizes at which your web
            page does not appear properly. For example, if we want to target tablets that are in landscape orientation, we can
            create the following breakpoint:
            
            @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) and (orientation: landscape) {
            /* CSS ruleset */
            }
            The example above creates a screen size range the size of a tablet in landscape mode and also identifies the
            orientation.
            
            However, setting breakpoints for every device imaginable would be incredibly difficult because there are many devices of
            differing shapes and sizes. In addition, new devices are released with new screen sizes every year.
            
            Rather than set breakpoints based on specific devices, the best practice is to resize your browser to view where the
            website naturally breaks based on its content. The dimensions at which the layout breaks or looks odd become your media
            query breakpoints. Within those breakpoints, we can adjust the CSS to make the page resize and reorganize.
            
            By observing the dimensions at which a website naturally breaks, you can set media query breakpoints that create the
            best possible user experience on a project by project basis, rather than forcing every project to fit a certain screen
            size. Different projects have different needs, and creating a responsive design should be no different.
            
            Check out this list of breakpoints by device widths. Use it as a reference of screen widths to test your website to make
            certain it looks great across a variety of devices.

        <h2>Review Media Queries</h2>
        <p>
            Incredible work! You learned how to change the way a website appears on different screens with media queries and
            breakpoints
            
            Throughout this lesson, you learned:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When a website responds to the size of the screen it’s viewed on, it’s called a <em>responsive website.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can write <em>media queries</em> to help with different screen sizes.
                </li>
                <li>Media queries require <em>media features.</em> Media features are the conditions that must be met to render the CSS within a
                media query.</li>
                <li>Media features can detect many aspects of a user’s browser, including the screen’s width, height, resolution,
                orientation, and more.</li>
                <li>The and operator requires multiple media features to be true at once.</li>
                <li>A comma separated list of media features only requires one media feature to be true for the code within to be applied.</li>
                <li>The best practice for identifying where media queries should be set is by resizing the browser to determine where the
                content naturally breaks. Natural breakpoints are found by resizing the browser.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With your knowledge of media queries and CSS, you can make websites that look great on any device, from a small phone to
            a huge television. By making your websites responsive, you’ll make it possible for any of your users to have a great
            experience.</p>
