            <h2>Percentages: Height & Width</h2>
            <p>To size non-text HTML elements relative to their parent elements on the page you can use percentages.
            
            Percentages are often used to size box-model values, like width and height, padding, border, and margins. They can also
            be used to set positioning properties (top, bottom, left, right).
            
            To start, let’s size the height and width of an element using percentages.</p>
            <p>
                In the example above, .main and .subsection each represent divs. The .subsection div is nested within the .main div.
                Note that the dimensions of the parent div (.main) have been set to a height of 300 pixels and a width of 500 pixels.
                
                When percentages are used, elements are sized relative to the dimensions of their parent element (also known as a
                container). Therefore, the dimensions of the .subsection div will be 150 pixels tall and 250 pixels wide. Be careful, a
                child element’s dimensions may be set erroneously if the dimensions of its parent element aren’t set first.
                
                Note: Because the box model includes padding, borders, and margins, setting an element’s width to 100% may cause content
                to overflow its parent container. While tempting, 100% should only be used when content will not have padding, border,
                or margin.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div>
            <h2>Padding & Margin</h2>
            <p>
                Percentages can also be used to set the padding and margin of elements.
                
                When height and width are set using percentages, you learned that the dimensions of child elements are calculated based
                on the dimensions of the parent element.
                
                When percentages are used to set padding and margin, however, they are calculated based only on the width of the parent
                element.
                
                For example, when a property like margin-left is set using a percentage (say 50%), the element will be moved halfway to
                the right in the parent container (as opposed to the child element receiving a margin half of its parent’s margin).
                
                Vertical padding and margin are also calculated based on the width of the parent. Why? 
                Consider the following scenario:
                <ol>
                <li>A container div is defined, but its height is not set (meaning it’s flat).</li>
                <li>The container then has a child element added within. The child element does have a set height. This causes the height of
                its parent container to stretch to that height.</li>
                <li>The child element requires a change, and its height is modified. This causes the parent container’s height to also
                stretch to the new height. This cycle occurs endlessly whenever the child element’s height is changed!</li></ol></p>
                <p>In the scenario above, an unset height (the parent’s) results in a constantly changing height due to changes to the
                child element. This is why vertical padding and margin are based on the width of the parent, and not the height.
                
                Note: When using relative sizing, ems and rems should be used to size text and dimensions on the page related to text
                size (i.e. padding around text). This creates a consistent layout based on text size. Otherwise, percentages should be
                used.
                </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="width">
        <div class="min">
            <h2>Width: Minimum & Maximum</h2>
            <p>
                Although relative measurements provide consistent layouts across devices of different screen sizes, elements on a
                website can lose their integrity when they become too small or large. You can limit how wide an element becomes with the
                following properties:
                
                min-width — ensures a minimum width for an element.
                max-width — ensures a maximum width for an element.
                p {
                min-width: 300px;
                max-width: 600px;
                }
                In the example above, when the browser is resized, the width of paragraph elements will not fall below 300 pixels, nor
                will their width exceed 600 pixels.
                
                When a browser window is narrowed or widened, text can become either very compressed or very spread out, making it
                difficult to read. These two properties ensure that content is legible by limiting the minimum and maximum widths.
                
                Note: The unit of pixels is used to ensure hard limits on the dimensions of the element(s).
            </p>
            <h2>Height: Minimum & Maximum</h2>
            <p>
                You can also limit the minimum and maximum height of an element.
                
                min-height — ensures a minimum height for an element’s box.
                max-height — ensures a maximum height for an element’s box.
                p {
                min-height: 150px;
                max-height: 300px;
                }
                In the example above, the height of all paragraphs will not shrink below 150 pixels and the height will not exceed 300
                pixels.
                
                What will happen to the contents of an element if the max-height property is set too low for that element? It’s possible
                that content will overflow outside of the element, resulting in content that is not legible.

            <h2>Scaling Images and Videos</h2>
            <p>
                Many websites contain a variety of different media, like images and videos. When a website contains such media, it’s
                important to make sure that it is scaled proportionally so that users can correctly view it.
                
                .container {
                width: 50%;
                height: 200px;
                overflow: hidden;
                }
                
                .container img {
                max-width: 100%;
                height: auto;
                display: block;
                }
                In the example above, .container represents a container div. It is set to a width of 50% (half of the browser’s width,
                in this example) and a height of 200 pixels. Setting overflow to hidden ensures that any content with dimensions larger
                than the container will be hidden from view.
                
                The second CSS rule ensures that images scale with the width of the container. The height property is set to auto,
                meaning an image’s height will automatically scale proportionally with the width. Finally, the last line will display
                images as block level elements (rather than inline-block, their default state). This will prevent images from attempting
                to align with other content on the page (like text), which can add unintended margin to the images.
                
                It’s worth memorizing the entire example above. It represents a very common design pattern used to scale images and
                videos proportionally.
                
                Note: The example above scales the width of an image (or video) to the width of a container. If the image is larger than
                the container, the vertical portion of the image will overflow and will not display. To swap this behavior, you can set
                max-height to 100% and width to auto (essentially swapping the values). This will scale the height of the image with the
                height of the container instead. If the image is larger than the container, the horizontal portion of the image will
                overflow and not display.
        
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="background">
        <div class="bgimage">
            <h2>Scaling Background Images</h2>
            <p>
                Background images of HTML elements can also be scaled responsively using CSS properties.
                
                body {
                background-image: url('#');
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
                background-position: center;
                background-size: cover;
                }
                In the example above, the first CSS declaration sets the background image (# is a placeholder for an image URL in this
                example). The second declaration instructs the CSS compiler to not repeat the image (by default, images will repeat).
                The third declaration centers the image within the element.
                
                The final declaration, however, is the focus of the example above. It’s what scales the background image. The image will
                cover the entire background of the element, all while keeping the image in proportion. If the dimensions of the image
                exceed the dimensions of the container then only a portion of the image will display.

            <h2>Review: Relative Measurements</h2>
            <p>
                Great work! You learned how to size elements on a website relative to other elements on the page.
                Let’s review what you learned:
                <ul>
                    <li>Content on a website can be sized relative to other elements on the page using <em>relative measurements</em>.</li>
                    <li>The unit of em sizes font relative to the font size of a parent element.</li>
                    <li>The unit of rem sizes font relative to the font size of a root element. That root element is the <em>html element</em>.</li>
                    <li>Percentages are commonly used to size box-model features, like the width, height, padding, or margin of an element.</li>
                    <li>When percentages are used to size width and height, child elements will be sized relative to the dimensions of their
                    parent (remember that parent dimensions must first be set).</li>
                    <li>Percentages can be used to set padding and margin. Horizontal and vertical padding and margin are set relative to the
                    width of a parent element.</li>
                    <li>The minimum and maximum width of elements can be set using min-width and max-width.</li>
                    <li>The minimum and maximum height of elements can be set using min-height and max-height.</li>
                    <li>When the height of an image or video is set, then its width can be set to auto so that the media scales proportionally.
                    Reversing these two properties and values will also achieve the same result.</li>
                    <li>A background image of an HTML element will scale proportionally when its background-size property is set to cover.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Relative units of measurement are a first step towards incorporating responsive design in a website. When combined with
                more advanced responsive techniques, you can create a seamless user experience regardless of a device’s screen size.

            <h2>Saturday Market</h2>
            <h3>January 7th</h3>
            <strong class="opening-line">On Saturday, Dilara took us to the market.</strong>
            <p>It is a wonderfully eclectic mix of goods from all over the world - delightfully random. I dusted off my
                bargaining skills to buy a metal bracelet with camels on it, and Maggie bought a lapis lazuli necklace
                from Afghanistan. In the evening, we walked along Gulf Road towards the marina, passed through Marina
                Mall, and ate dinner at a wonderful little cafe that we will definitely be frequenting. I’ve developed a
                slight obsession with lentil soul... maybe it’s because I miss Foco’s Indian lentil chili.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./style/images/brush.png" />
            </div>
            <p>We took a catamaran from the marina to Failaka Island, where we got to explore a bit, relax on the beach,
                and go swimming. The water in the Gulf is incredibly still; I haven’t seen a wave yet, and when you look
                out on the horizon it seems to go forever. Something about the color of the water and maybe the dust in
                the air make it seem hazier than the Atlantic coast. I have some cool pictures of the city skyline as we
                returned on the boat.</p>
            <p>That night, I hung out in a cafe with two friends, drinking traditional lemonade with mint. It’s
                delicious; maybe I should send in a flavor suggestion to Morano Gelato? Then we drove around the city
                for a while. Cruising around is a really valid way to spend the time when a tank of gas costs about
                seven bucks. </p>
