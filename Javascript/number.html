            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>
                In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal, but you have an output section to help you test your functions and show you if you have syntax errors.

            <p>
                The goal of this unit was to introduce you to JavaScript, the basic syntax and the primary concepts needed to write a JavaScript program.
                Having completed this unit, you are now able to:
                * Understand how JavaScript is used for web development,
                * Run JavaScript on your computer, 
                * Run JavaScript in the browser, 
                * Understand introductory JavaScript syntax, 
                * Practice JavaScript syntax
