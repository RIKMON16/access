            <h3>Data Instances</h3>
            <p>
                When a new piece of data is introduced into a JavaScript program, the program keeps track of it in an instance of that data type. An instance is an individual case of a data type.

            <h3>Null</h3>
            <p>
                Null is a primitive data type. It represents the intentional absence of value. In code, it is represented as null.

            <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
            <p>Java Script supports Arithmetic operators:
                
                    + addition, 
        - subtraction
                    , * multiplication, 
                    / division, 
                    % modulo
                
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Multi-line Comments</h3>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, multi-line comments are created by surrounding the lines with /* at the beginning and */ at the end. Comments are good ways for a variety of reasons like explaining a code block or indicating some hints, etc.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Remainder / Modulo Operator</h3>
            <p>
                The remainder operator, sometimes called modulo, returns the number that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can.

        <section><h3>Assignment Operators</h3><p>An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Here are some of them: += addition assignment, -= subtraction assignment, *= multiplication assignment, /= division assignment</p>

            <h3>String Interpolation</h3>
            <p>
                String interpolation is the process of evaluating string literals containing one or more placeholders (expressions, variables, etc).

                It can be performed using template literals: text ${expression} text.

            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>
                Variables are used whenever thereâ€™s a need to store a piece of data. A variable contains data that can be used in the program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can be used to replace the same value in multiple places.
            </p>

            <h3>Undefined</h3>
            <p>
                undefined is a primitive JavaScript value that represents lack of defined value. Variables that are declared but not initialized to a value will have the value undefined.
            </p>

            <h3>Learn Javascript: Variables</h3>
            <p>
                A variable is a container for data that is stored in computer memory. It is referenced by a descriptive name that a programmer can call to assign a specific value and retrieve it.
            </p>

                Declaring Variables
            </h3>
            <p>
                To declare a variable in JavaScript, any of these three keywords can be used along with a variable name:
                <dl>
                    <li>var is used in pre-ES6 versions of JavaScript.</li>
                    <dd>let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned.</dd>
                    <li>const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.</li>
                </dl>
            </p>

            <h3>Template Literals</h3>
            <p>
                Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions, ${expression}. While regular strings use single ' or double " quotes, template literals use backticks instead.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>let Keyword</h3>
            <p>
                let creates a local variable in JavaScript & can be re-assigned. Initialization during the declaration of a let variable is optional. A let variable will contain undefined if nothing is assigned to it.
            </p>

            <h3>
                const Keyword
            </h3>
            <p>
                A constant variable can be declared using the keyword const. It must have an assignment. Any attempt of re-assigning a const variable will result in JavaScript runtime error.
            </p>

            <h3>String Concatenation</h3>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, multiple strings can be concatenated together using the + operator. In the example, multiple strings and variables containing string values have been concatenated. After execution of the code block, the displayText variable will contain the concatenated string.
