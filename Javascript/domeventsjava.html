                <h2>What is an Event?</h2>
                <p>When you refresh your email inbox, double tap on a post, or scroll through a newsfeed — something cool happens in your browser. These actions are known as events!</p>
                <p>Events on the web are user interactions and browser manipulations that you can program to trigger functionality. Some other examples of events are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A mouse clicking on a button</li>
                    <li>Webpage files loading in the browser</li>
                    <li>A user swiping right on an image</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When a user does any of the above actions, they’re causing the event to be fired or be triggered. As in, “a click event fired when the button was clicked”. Being able to respond to these events makes your website interactive and therefore dynamic</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-10">
                <h2>"Firing" Events</h2>
                <p>After a specific event fires on a specific element in the document object model (or DOM), an event handler function can be created to run as a response. In this lesson, we will learn about event handler functions that modify and update DOM elements after an event fires.</p>
                <p>Let’s compare the firing of events to something more familiar: a dog trained to eat when they hear the sound of a bell! (This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">Pavlovian Conditioning</a></p>
                <p>As you can see in the diagram, the ringing of the bell is analogous to a JavaScript event firing. The dog is trained to anticipate the ringing of the bell and this action is analogous to creating an event listener. After the dog hears the bell, it’ll come over and eat its food! This response is like an event handler function that executes code which, in a website, could change an element’s color, text, and much more!”</p>
                <p>Most events in the browser take place without being noticed — the events are undetected because there is no event handler associated with the event to execute an action. Event handlers are crucial for creating interactive websites with JavaScript.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-9">
                <h2>Event Handler Registration</h2>
                <p>You’re doing great! Now it’s time to dive into using event handler functions to create interactivity. Using the .addEventListener() method, we can have a DOM element listen for a specific event and execute a block of code when the event is detected. The DOM element that listens for an event is called the event target and the block of code that runs when the event happens is called the event handler.</p>
                <p>Let’s take a look at the code below:</p>
                <div class="card" style="width: 22rem;">
                        <div class="card-body alert alert-primary">
                            <p>let eventTarget = document.getElementById('targetElement');</p>
                            <p>eventTarget.addEventListener('click', function() {</p>
                            <p>// this block of code will run when click event happens on eventTarget element});</p>
                        </div>
                </div>
                <p>Let’s break this down!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We selected our event target from the DOM using document.getElementById('targetElement').</li>
                    <li>We used the .addEventListener() method on the eventTarget DOM element.</li>
                    <li>The .addEventListener() method takes two arguments: an event name in string format and an event handler function. We will learn about different values we can use as event names in a later lesson.</li>
                    <li>In this example, we used the 'click' event, which fires when the user clicks on eventTarget.</li>
                    <li>The code block in the event handler function will execute when the 'click' event is detected.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Instead of using an anonymous function as the event handler, it’s best practice to create a named event handler function. Your code will remain organized and reusable this way, even if your code gets complex. Check out the syntax:</p>
                <div class="card" style="width: 22rem;">
                    <div class="card-body alert alert-primary">
                        <p>function eventHandlerFunction() {// this block of code will run when click event happens}</p>
                        <p>eventTarget.addEventListener('click', eventHandlerFunction);</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The named function eventHandlerFunction is passed as the second argument of the .addEventListener() method instead of defining an anonymous function within the method!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8">
                  <section id='container'>
                        <p id='info'>JavaScript is the programming language of the web. You can use it to add dynamic behavior and store information.

                    </section>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="col-xs-8">
                <h3>Adding Event Handlers</h3>
                <p>We looked at registering event handlers using the <strong>.addEventListener()</strong> method, but there is also another way!</p>
                <p>Event Handlers can also be registered by setting an .onevent property on a DOM element (event target). The pattern for registering a specific event is to append an element with .on followed by the lowercased event type name. For instance, if we want to register a click event with this pattern, we would write:</p>
                <div class="card" style="width: 22rem;">
                    <div class="card-body alert alert-primary">
                        <p>eventTarget.onclick = eventHandlerFunction;</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Here, we give the DOM element eventTarget the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onclick">.onclick property</a> and set its value as the event handler function eventHandlerFunction.</p>
                <p>It’s important to know that this .onevent property and .addEventListener() will both register event listeners. With .onevent, it allows for one event handler function to be attached to the event target. However, with the .addEventListener() method , we can add multiple event handler functions. In the later exercises, we’ll be using the .addEventListener() syntax, but we wanted to also introduce the .onevent syntax because both are widely used.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-8">
                <h3>Removing Event Handlers</h3>
                <p>The .removeEventListener() method is used to reverse the .addEventListener() method. This method stops the event target from “listening” for an event to fire when it no longer needs to. .removeEventListener() also takes two arguments:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The event type as a string</li>
                    <li>The event handler function</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Check out the syntax of a .removeEventListener() method with a click event:</p>
                <div class="card" style="width: 22rem;">
                    <div class="card-body alert alert-primary">
                        <p>eventTarget.removeEventListener('click', eventHandlerFunction);</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Because there can be multiple event handler functions associated with a particular event, .removeEventListener() needs both the exact event type name and the name of the event handler you want to remove. If .addEventListener() was provided an anonymous function, then that event listener cannot be removed.</p>
                <a href="./domtest2.html" class="btn btn-primary">DOM TEST 2</a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-8">
                <h3>Event Object Properties</h3>
                <p>JavaScript stores events as Event objects with their related data and functionalities as properties and methods. When an event is triggered, the event object can be passed as an argument to the event handler function.</p>
                <div class="card" style="width: 22rem;"> 
                    <div class="card-body alert alert-primary">
                        <p>function eventHandlerFunction(event){</p>
                        <p>console.log(event.timeStamp);}</p>
                        <p>eventTarget.addEventListener('click',eventHandlerFunction);</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In the example above, when the 'click' event is triggered on the eventTarget, the eventHandlerFunction receives event, the Event object, which has information related to the 'click' event. Then, we log the time it took for the event to be triggered since the document was loaded by accessing the .timeStamp property of the event object.</p>
                <p>There are pre-determined properties associated with event objects. You can call these properties to see information about the event, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target">.target property</a> to reference the element that the event is registered to.</li>
                    <li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/type">.type property</a> to access the name of the event.</li>
                    <li>the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/timeStamp">.time property</a> to access the number of milliseconds that passed since the document loaded and the event was triggered.</li>
                </ul>
                <a href="./domtest3.html" class="btn btn-primary">DOM TEST 3</a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-8">
                <h3>Event Types</h3>
                <p>Beyond the click event, there are all types of DOM events that can fire in a browser! It’s important to know most events in the DOM take place without being noticed because there are no event handlers connected to them.</p>
                <p>It’s also important to know some registered events don’t depend on user interactions to fire. For instance, the load event fires after website files completely load in the browser.</p>
                <p>Browsers can fire many other events without a user — you can check out a list of events on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">MDN Events List</a> page.</p>
                <p>Many events need user interaction with the DOM to fire. One user interaction event you’ve become familiar with is the click event. A click event fires when the user presses and releases a mouse button on an element in the DOM.</p>
                <a href="./domtest4.html" class="btn btn-primary">DOM TEST 4</a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-8">
                <h3>Mouse Events</h3>
                <p>When you use a mouse device on a website, mouse events fire. You’ve seen the click and wheel events, but, there are even mouse events to explore!</p>
                <p>The mousedown event is fired when the user presses a mouse button down. This is different from a click event because mousedown doesn’t need the mouse button to be released to fire.</p>
                <p>The mouseup event is fired when the user releases the mouse button. This is different from the click and mousedown events because mouseup doesn’t depend on the mouse button being pressed down to fire.</p>
                <p>The mouseover event is fired when the mouse enters the content of an element.</p>
                <p>The mouseout event is fired when the mouse leaves an element.</p>
                <p><a href="./domtest5.html" class="btn btn-primary">DOM TEST 5</a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-8">
                <h3>Keyboard Events</h3>
                <p>Other popular types of events are keyboard events! keyboard events are triggered by user interaction with keyboard keys in the browser.</p>
                <p>The keydown event is fired while a user presses a key down.</p>
                <p>The keyup event is fired while a user releases a key.</p>
                <p>The keypress event is fired when a user presses a key down and releases it. This is different from using keydown and keyup events together, because those are two complete events and keypress is one complete event.</p>
                <p>Keyboard events have unique properties assigned to their event objects like the .key property that stores the values of the key pressed by the user. You can program the event handler function to react to a specific key, or react to any interaction with the keyboard.</p>
